"You Can Win" by Shiv Khera is my favourite book, it is appreciated for its motivational and transformative influence. The book inspires me with practical insights, empowering me to foster a positive mindset, set goals, and overcome challenges. Khera's motivational approach, coupled with real-life anecdotes, makes the book a valuable guide for achieving personal and professional success.
